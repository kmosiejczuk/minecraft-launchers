# minecraft-launchers
OpenBSD Minecraft launchers based upon minecraft-launcher-lib

You will need the py3-minecraft-launcher-lib, jdk-11, lwjgl, and (upcoming)
lwjgl3 ports installed to be able to use these to launch Minecraft on
OpenBSD. Tested on 6.8-current as of 2021-02-07

These are still pretty crude (having edit them to put in your username
and password), but they _work_.

(Technically, you only need the lwjgl ports for 1.12.2 or earlier. Also,
one only needs lwjgl3 for >= 1.13)
